            <h1>Best Life Quote</h1>
            <p>As a student of the R.I.C.H I have found out that there is a secret code they 
                live by.<br> It is never in the front end, it is always in the back end. It is in the systems they
                create<br> and in the people they affect. They know that they don't win alone, they carry people along.<br>
                The journey is never done alone.

                me with so much wisdom. Watching his YouTube Videos daily gives me this motivation 
                to move on with life.
